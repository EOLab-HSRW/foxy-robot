# Foxy Robot

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note tha this project is currently under active construction, so it is reasonable to expect some problems and bugs (you can report them in [our github repo](https://github.com/EOLab-HSRW/foxy-robot/)). When it reaches a more mature and stable state this text will be removed.

You can think of the **Foxy robot** as a reimagining of the [duckiebot](https://get.duckietown.com/products/duckiebot-db21) robot developed by [Duckietown](https://duckietown.com/). You may be wondering - why reimplement the robot? -, well the short answer is to fit the robot to a different need, but if you want to read the long answer check out the blog [Let's talk about Duckietown](https://wiki.eolab.de/doku.php?id=blog:lets-talk-about-duckietown).

This reimplementation is born in the heart of the [EOLab (Earth Observation Lab)](https://www.eolab.de/) at the [Hoschschule Rhein Waal](https://www.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/en/) in the [Faculty of Communication and Environment](https://www.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/en/faculties/communication-and-environment)  in Kamp-Lintfort Germany, which together with volunteers from [Universidad de O'Higgins](https://www.uoh.cl/) at the [UOH AI & Robotics Group](https://sites.google.com/uoh.cl/uoh-ai-robotics-group/home) in Rancagua Chile decided to join forces with a **Robotics Working Group** to share and exchange knowledge and skills in the area of robotics.
